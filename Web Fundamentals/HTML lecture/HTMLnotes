HTTP REQ/RES cycle
How does the internet work?

Browser sends info (eg google.com) to DNS look up
DNS sends back IP address back to Browser
Browser sends request data (HTTP request) to the IP address server
  Server has a "defense layer" (web server) that processes the request (eg cashier at in-n-out)
    Load balancer is a type of web server
  Logic unit gets data from the web server and processes the data (eg does DB need to be accessed?)
    This is where processes like GET and POST are processed
Server sends back HTTP response back to the client (HTML, CSS, JS)



HTML is the structure of a website
CSS is the styling
JS is the user interaction (events)
